Worldwide Gender Gap

#Select Indicator
There are three indicators upon which the user will be able to see the worldwide gender gap. It will initially be the overall GDP, but the gender gap indicators are Education, Wages, and Participation in the Labor Force.



#World Map

For each indicator, the world map will show the data distribution for each country. According to the Legend (bellow of the world map), each country's color scheme is used. Here, all data are for the year 2016. Upon clicking on each country, the selected indicator's specific data will be shown underneath the world map. Additionally, the country containing the maximum value of the selected indicator will be shown. So, the user will be able to compare the selected country's value with the maximum value. Moreover, after selecting each country, that country's data will be shown in the "Comparison of Women with Men" section.


#Region Wise

Using the sunburst, the user can also zoom into different regions of the world. Different regions are highlighted with different colors. Upon zooming into a region, the user can select a country from the sunburst, and that country's data will be shown in the "Comparison of Women with Men" section.




#Comparison of Women with Men

In this section, there is a line chart and a bar chart. After selecting a country from the world map or the sunburst, this section will exhibit the selected indicator's yearly data. Here, we have a line chart and a bar chart. The line chart shows the yearly data for men for each year, while the bar chart shows the women data for each year. From these two types of charts, the selected indicator's gap is easily understandable for the user. Moreover, the data for both men and women will be displayed for the user for both lines and bar chart upon mouseover.

#Heatmap showing women-centric data for countries over the years

For the selected indicator, all country's temporal data for women will be shown in the heatmap. It will help the user comprehensively understand how the women-centric data are changing over the last few years. We have shown data from the year 2000 to 2016 (due to availability)
